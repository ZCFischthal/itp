# JavascriptReading
## Values, Types, and Operators
### I knew
... about the modulo (%, remainder operation)
### I didn't know
... about the *special* numbers. I'd heard of/seen NaN before (although I didn't know that it meant "Not a Number") but I didn't realize "Infinity" and "-Infinity" were also numbers in JS.
## Program Structure
### I knew
... a lot of the basics like "let", "var", and "const" (although I only know the little that the chapter goes over).
### I didn't know
... the shortcut to view the JS browser console (cmd-opt-i).
## Functions
### I knew
... some stuff about functions, like how you can make bindings for them/give them names.
### I didn't know
... function declarations can be written wherever but will be read at the top of the block anyway. It feels like it might be nicer for human purposes to keep all your function declarations near each other in the block, but it's cool they don't need to be at the top.
