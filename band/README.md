# FindingEmo
I've lost my emo.
## Design
* One header
* Bios
  * 4
* 3+ assets
  * Logo
  * Click to stream our album (rickroll)
  * Band picture before bios

## What we did
Typed requirements above
Looked at https://rdwrome.github.io/ for heading stuff
Everyone around went looking for pictures, making bios, etc. — Annie got the beautiful band photo, Sebastian got the band logo, Julian helped me w/ the github stuff
I tried to make a new website before asking and then just used my normal one
All tested the website on our own machines bc it wouldn't update at the same time on everyone's
Stole code for audio controls from https://rdwrome.github.io/
	Missed stuff needed in header — added
	Mistyped "rick-roll.mp3" vs "Rick-roll.mp3"
Added div to make stuff centered at Julian's request, one image still not
I did all the code in github which I'm realizing was maybe not the move bc it's really annoying but oh well learn for next time
added CSS sheet so we can change more stuff — black background
Made band logo centered (I had style="text-align: center" in both the <> and in a div, so I think it was confused — got rid of that and it was fine)

NOTE: fonts and images were uploaded to the repository

Had like 40 minutes left so I decided to steal a bunch of stuff from my musical's website (https://zincpetals.neocities.org/monsters/mainpage) so we could have a real header w/ a second page
Gave us a header (stolen exactly from my website), added a 2nd page for Bios, split the first page we did so all the bio stuff is on the second page and the rest is on the first — no one asked me to do this I just thought it would be fun and easy bc I already had the code

Added Wendy bc we were messing around. Realized paragraphs weren't split up correctly/it would look nicer, so added "br"
Used https://www.pinterest.com/pin/611645193124848156/ img for Wendy background

## Assessment
Everyone did great! Julian helped a lot with the web design part (things being centered, having a title, black background) and Annie and Sebastian found all of the images and had the idea to rickroll everyone.
